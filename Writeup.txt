report:
  This site solved the problem of the default final: the image storing/editing 
  site. we attempted to solve this problem with a layout plan and tried out best 
  to get the site to look like out plans. I set up a skeleton of the webpage while 
  my partner looked for useful tools to enact our plans. By the time I had 
  finished with the skeleton, he had started feeding me the code to make the site 
  work. I then more or less spent the majority of my time adding and debugging the 
  code that was given to my by my partner after agreeing that it did what we wanted 
  it to. We finished off the project by working together on the stylings of the page.

We had to leave in some errors that we could not find the source of. On the main page, 
the first image will never load, however the modal still works correctly when a user 
clicks on the absent image. Sometimes the twitter share button disappears, but will 
reappear on page refesh. Something (we believe the weblab servers had something to 
do with it) would not allow the webpage to access the computer's folders, so saving 
and deleting became impossible.
